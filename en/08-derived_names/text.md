#DERIVED NOUNS (NAMES OF FRUITS, FLOWERS, TREES AND JOBS)

In Vèneto these names are derived from other nouns by adding special endings and are
employed very often. For example in Venetan the names of flowers and fruits are the base to
derive the names of trees, through the desinence –aro o –èr.

For example:
pómo (=it. apple) à pomaro/pomèr , péro (=it. pear) à peraro/perèr
roxa (=it. rose) à roxaro/roxèr , o£iva (=it. olive) à o£ivaro/o£ivèr
s(i)aréxa (=it. cherry) à s(i)arexara , nóxa (=it. nut) à nogara/noghera
caco (=it. kaki) à cacaro , figo (=it. fig) à figaro/fighèr
This pattern is quite regular (note however that some names of fruits are masculine in Vèneto
differently from italian) and only sometimes there are irregular consonant changes as x->g.
Also some names of job are derived:
lataro (ß late) ; benxinaro/benxinèr (ß benxina)
vacaro/vachèr (ß vaca) ; mo£inaro/mo£inèr (ß molin)
Note that the ending -aro/-èr refers to both the person who works, and the place where
the work is done:thus benxinaro/benxinèr is the sevice-station attendant, and the servicestation
itself.

Likewise, the caxara/caxera is the place in the mountains where people produce(d) cheese,
from latin caseus=cheese. And the caxaro is he who produces cheese.
