#COMPOUND PREPOSITIONS

At the beginning of this book, articles (definite, indefinite and personal) have been shown to
merge with some base preposition: del, al, col, dal, ’ntel, int’un, pa’l, sul…

Still, these are not the only prepositions; there are also complex prepositions (da)drio=behind,
vizsin=near, (da)vanti=before/in front, insieme=together, senzsa=without which combine with
base preposition, usually de. Of course articles, too, can appear.

Thus one forms: (da)drio del tren, (da)drio de Marco, vizsin de mi, vizsin de £a Marìa, vanti de
mi, insieme co mi, senzsa de voaltre…

These prepositions are not always compound, but can also stand alone e.g.: drio caxa, drio na
carega, vizsin caxa, vizsin £a Céxa, senzsa £a to£a, senzsa un scheo, sóto el pòrtego.

##PRONOMINAL PREPOSITIONS
There are varieties of the Venetan language, in which some prepositions besides merging with
articles, also combine with personal pronouns as usually happens in gaelic languages (irlish,
scottish) or in hebrew. For example one may hear and sometimes read such forms:
drio de mi drìome behind me
drio de ti drìote behind you (sg.)
drio de elo (o lu) drìoghe behind him/her/them
drio de si drìose behind himself/hers...
And so on…
