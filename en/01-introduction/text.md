#INTRODUCTION

Vèneto dialects are parts of one and the same linguistic system, the Veneto language or
*Venetan*, because they share the same linguistic structures, namely those of Vèneto: therefore
all of them are varieties of *Venetan*, the Vèneto-language.

**For the sake of linguistic clarity and following M.Parry and M.Maiden, in this book the
word *Vèneto/Venetan* (i.e. general venetian) will refer to the whole Vèneto language
spoken under different varieties, whereas the word *Venetian* (i.e. venetian proper,
“venician”) will be reserved only to one variety of this language, namely that which
is spoken in the city of Venice.**

This distinction is also reflected in the words that Vèneti themselves employ: *parlar vèneto*
“speaking Venetan” in general, derived from the geographical name Vèneto, and *parlar
venesian* “speaking *venic*ian”, from the local city name *Venesia* i.e. Venice.

Using the same word for both meanings, would be like confusing the German language with its
Berlinian variety or confusing the English language with its Cockney variety or saying that
Catalan language is just “Barcelonian”.

The aim of this grammar book is not to describe one variety (only veronese Venetan, only
venetian Venetan, only feltrino-belunese Venetan, only trevisan Venetan, only central Venetan
i.e. vicentin-paduan-polesan) but to describe the whole *Vèneto* language. In addition to this,
there are also some special notes about the tipical features of each of the main varieties.

Of course, this work is not perfect even in the most particular details and other corrections
can be made, but what is most important is that the *MGX de ła Łéngua Vèneta* aims to provide
a look at the whole language describing its main rules, existing under the different
pronunciation varieties: those rules that make us claiming that venetian is Venetan much the
same as belunese, even if these varieties are very different from one another; those rules that
make us Veneti understand each other even if we come from different places and speak in
different ways, while “*foresti*” (i.e. people who come from “outside”, without any contempt)
hardly understand what we say.

In the last part of the book, a short chapter is reserved for a brief description of the *Venetan
dialect of Italian (language)* which is spoken in cities and among young people, in order to
make clear the main differences that it has from the *Venetan language*.
