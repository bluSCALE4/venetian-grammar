#OTHER CONSTRUCTIONS: “aver da” , “dover” ,
“ghe xe/gh’è da” , “cogne” , “bexon’/bexogna”#

In Vèneto language there is a lot of verbal constructions, sometimes identical to their italian
counterparts sometimes with a slightly different meaning, which cannot be easily translated
but whose meaning is clear to people who know this language.

As German or English, for example, Vèneto language distinguishes different nuances of
obligation. In Italian the verb «dovere» is always used while in Vèneto the periphrasis aver da
+ infinite is employed which corresponds to “must/have to”: go da partir (=I have to go =it.
devo partire) , te ga/ghè da conprar el pan (= you must/have to buy some bread =it. devi
comprare il pane) , i ga/à da vìnzsar(e) (=they have to win =they must win). It corresponds
to Spanish tenir que , Catalan haver de or German müssen...

The impersonal form (used to indicate an obligation without saying whose duty is this) is: ghe
xe/gh’è da + infinite: gh’è da tor el pan (=one/someone must buy some bread = lit. there
is to buy some bread) , ghe xe da far un saco de robe (=many things must be done, there
is a lot of things to do)... This corresponds to Spanish hay que or to Catalan cal + infinite.

Other verbs or impersonal forms employed are: cogne dir che (=one must say that =it need
be said that) , cognéa senpre portar via tuto (=one had to take away everything...) or also
bexon’ (<-bexogna) tornar caxa (=one has to/must go back home) , bexon’ far pulito (=
behave politely is required= lit. one must behave politely). They often correspond to the
English passive imperative.

To give advice, on the contrary, the verb dover (ted.sollen, ingl.should) is employed,
especially in the conditional mood: te/ti dovarìsi parlarghe (=you should speak to
him/her/them) , i dovarìa provar da nóvo (=they should try again), te dovarìa ciorla ti
(=you should take it, by yourself...)
