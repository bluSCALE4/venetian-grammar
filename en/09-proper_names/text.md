#PROPER NAMES

Some words must be spended about proper names: indeed there are some differences in
compare to italian language.

As can be seen in the first chapter, in Vèneto there is also a personal article which compulsorily
introduces feminine proper names: you say go visto Mario but in the feminine go visto £a
Marìa; you say Gigi el vien but in the feminine £a Sandra £a vien. Likewise £a Làura,
l’Alesandra, l’Ana and even foreign names £a Roby, £a Susy...
Feminine proper names, indeed, always have the personal article so that by exclusion the
names withouth the personal article are always masculine.
This is specially visible in shortened names (£a Federica, Federico ; L’ Alesandra, Alesandro):
Go visto £a Fede = I have seen Federica (f.) =it. Ho visto Federica
Go visto Fede = I have seen Federico/Frederick (m.) =it. Ho visto Federico
I ga parlà co l’ Ale = They have spoken to Alexandra (f.) =it. Hanno parlato con Alessandra
I ga parlà co Ale = They have spoken to Alexander (m.) =it. Hanno parlato con Alessandro
The same holds for feminine surnames. Surnames with personal article are always feminine:
for example i ga nominà £a Tatcher primo ministro makes clear that a woman is spoken
about. By exclusion, surnames withouth article are compulsorily masculine: i ga nominà Blair
primo ministro means that a man is being spoken about.
