#THE IMPERSONAL PASSIVE

Intransitive verbs, too, can appear in the passive voice: since intransitive verbs have no direct
object to turn into subject, they have an impersonal passive form without subject (cfr. German
es wurde getanzt = lit. there was danced / it was danced).

The impersonal passive is built in the past tense with Xe/Gh’è stà + past participle (literally
“there has been...”). The indirect objects retain the same preposition they have in the active
voice.

For examples verbs parlar co (to speak with/to) , tełefonar a (lit. to telephone to) have the
following impersonal passive forms:
Xe stà parlà co tuti = Everybody was spoken to.
lit.”(there) has been spoken with everybody”
Gh’è stà tełefonà al dotor? = Did someone (of you) phone the doctor?
lit. “Has (there) been phoned to the doctor?”

Likewise, the impersonal passive of parlar de (to speak about) and discùter de (to discuss
about) is the following:

Gh’è stà parlà de un saco de robe = A lot of issues have been spoken about.
lit.“There has been spoken about a lot of things”
Ieri xe stà discuso del tràfico = Yesterday there was a discussion about the traffic.
lit.“ Yesterday (there) has been discussed about the traffic”
Note: The passive is less often used in Venetan, since usually a 3RD pl. active form is employed
(i ga discuso/parlà de = they have discussed/spoken about...) when it the subject is
unknown by the speaker and the hearer. On the contrary, the passive is preferred when the
subject might be the speaker or the hearer.
